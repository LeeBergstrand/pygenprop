       "  'This pathway for the biosynthesis of L-lysine differs from the more common diaminopimelate pathway by the action of diaminopimelate dehydrogenase (ddh). This enzyme requires both ammonia as a nitrogen source (instead of an amino acid via a transaminase) and reductive power in the form of NADPH. Additionally, this pathway does not require the acetyl/succinyl protecting group transformations found in the standard pathway, nor does it require the action of diaminopimelate epimerase. This enzyme has been best characterized in Corynebacterium glutamicum and Bacillus sphaericus. One should note that the ddh enzyme is shown acting on the compound L-2-amino-6-oxoheptanedioate in EC and KEGG representations. This is merely the ring-opened form of 2,3,4,5-tetrahydropicolinate with which it is in equilibrium, and upon which the acyltransferases of the common pathway act.',\n",

The two key enzymes of this pathway, encoded by CofG and CofH in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, are encoded by fusion proteins in certain lineages. The fusion protein in Mycobacterium smegmatis is designated FbiC (F420 BIosynthesis C). The precursors are a pyrimidine intermediate from riboflavin biosynthesis and the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate precursor of tyrosine, so expressing FbiC in Escherichia coli is sufficient for FO biosynthesis [2].',\n",
